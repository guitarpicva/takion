PLEASE NOTE: This information is rather stale, so please only use it for reference materia.
The TAK Product Center has better ways to do this now.

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint (and yes Centos7) installation instructions for the TAK server.

The Centos7 notes are included for completeness and reference.

Once the OS configuration is complete, the standard TAK server setup and configuration is 
the same as on Centos7.
